What is a Conventional Fire Alarm System?
A Conventional Fire Alarm System is a crucial component of a building’s fire protection strategy. Unlike addressable systems that pinpoint the exact location of the fire, conventional systems work by dividing a building into different zones. These systems are designed to detect smoke, heat, or flames in each specific zone and activate an alert when a potential fire hazard is detected. Conventional fire alarm systems are ideal for smaller buildings, retrofits, or budget-conscious projects that still require reliable fire safety.
